We have designed and developed a java swing application which manages leftover dairy produces like milk, butter etc. 
The main objective of this project is to help underpreviledged people by providing them surplus dairy products.
We have also implemented a quality check procedure, where Government checks if the dairy products are appropriate for donating to NGO or should go to waste.
A system Admin is responsible for adding any new role in the system and can access the data anytime.
